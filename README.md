# beautifularry
1. Takes interger input from the user.
2. If you multiply 0 with 1, you get 0, we see that a0 = 0. So, the array is beautiful.
3.  If you multiply 5 with 6, you get 30, there does not exist an k such that ak = 30. So, the array is not beautiful.
4.  #gets user input and returns a string splits that input on whitespaces, applies the function fn to each element in the sequence, applies int to each string element in the input.
5.  An array a is called beautiful if for every pair of numbers ai, aj, (i â‰  j), there exists an ak such that ak = ai * aj. Note that k can be equal to i or j too.
6. Executing the statement if it's satisfy then it will increment the value of input and store it.
7. Executing when the above statement if it's dis-satisfy then it will increment the value of input and store it on variable d.
8.  This varifies again when if above condition in not valid and if this satisfy then print no or else part will be executed directly.
